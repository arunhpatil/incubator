# microRNA genes and products nomenclature

The situation:
Clear and unambiguous microRNA naming is essential for accurate communication. Many ways have been used over the years to name microRNA genes, their products but also their intermediate forms (primary transcripts and precursors). miRBase, the international reference microRNA database, Gene Nomenclature Consortia (HGNC, MGI, ZFIN, etc...), and researchers often use different nomenclature rules.

A unified nomenclature system is thus needed to improve communication.

The optimal system should:
  - be applicable to all metazoan species 
  - be consistent with each species' gene nomenclature guidelines (HGNC for Human, MGI for Mouse, ZFIN for Fish, etc) 
  - be evolutionarily robust
  
A unified system for microRNA naming would permit more efficient communication between researchers within a species or across species because the naming would be consistent and follow familiar guidelines used for protein-coding genes.
  
*Note:*
*Plants miRNA research is facing the same problems. The different origin of plant and metazoan miRNA systems, however, make the creation of a unified “plant and metazoan” pattern hazardous. Nevertheless, tentative standardization on specific aspects is a future goal of the group.*

#Comments:
Two recent articles from two independent groups have simultaneously proposed novel nomenclature guidelines to improve microRNA naming:

One article (Fromm et al, 2015) focused on evolutionary conservation and clear orthology establishment to provide phylogenetically informative names based on human annotation, while the other (Desvignes et al, 2015) envisioned a system for sequence variation analysis following nomenclature guidelines in use for protein-coding genes. 

Both systems have advantages and problems. 

The Fromm et al system (2015) has the advantages of establishing clear orthologies between genes across species and renaming orthologs in a similar way in all species and harmonizes names within a miRNA family. As a problems: a lot of names are modified. Most researchers have now been used to specific microRNA numbers for years. Changing many names, even though clarifying evolutionary relationships between microRNAs, can be confusing and is unlikely to be followed. The nomenclature system proposed also doesn't follow any of the gene nomenclature guidelines established by nomenclature consortia. The system is also human centric and poses problem because human should not be envisioned as the end or start point in evolutionary studies, and because this human-centered system is not evolutionarily robust with for example genome duplication events such as the two rounds of whole genome duplication that occurred at the stem of the vertebrate radiation, or the teleost specific whole genome duplication event.

The second system (Desvignes et al, 2015) on the other hand, doesn't changes the number constituting the microRNA name but strongly encourages researchers, when identifying new miRNAs, to perform accurate phylogenetic verifications to provide phylogenetically conform names. This nomenclature system has been elaborated in collaboration with the mouse and zebrafish gene nomenclature consortia (MGI and ZFIN respectively) to follow general gene nomenclature guidelines, and is now the system in use in these gene nomenclature authorities. It is also in agreement with the guidelines in use for Human and other animal models. Finally, the phylogenetic relationship between orthologs, co-orthologs and paralogs are dealt similarly to relationships between protein-coding genes and is thus a system already used by everyone and phylogenetically robust; but the names are not homogenized like in the Fromm system.
